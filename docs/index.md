# March Madness Prediction Challenge

## Predicting NCAA Tournament Outcomes with Machine Learning

![Basketball Tournament](/march-madness-prediction/assets/basketball.jpg)

This project explores the use of machine learning to predict outcomes in the NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament (March Madness). We developed multiple prediction models that leverage historical game data, team performance metrics, expert ratings, and betting market information.

## Project Highlights

- üèÜ Achieved a **0.459 log loss score**, outperforming the previous year's winning submission (0.515)
- üìä Engineered 22 predictive features from multiple data sources
- üîç Compared multiple machine learning approaches including classification and regression models
- üìà Found that betting odds significantly improved prediction accuracy

## Key Results

Our comprehensive model comparison revealed that classification models consistently outperformed regression approaches, and that incorporating betting odds data provided substantial predictive power:
